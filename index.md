## Section 1





Alan Carrizosa Acevedo (b. 2000, Texas) is a designer and researcher based in New York City. He brings a keen and capricious sensibility to expanding the agency of architecture by conceding architectureâ€™s conventions, dialectics, and aesthetics through his design processes. He studied architecture at Texas A&M University & is currently a Master of Architecture Candidate at Princeton University; where he is editor of Rumor Reviews. He has worked for the offices: MOS in NYC, Michael Maltzan Architecture in Los Angeles and CRTKL in Dallas. His interests leverage the architectural surface to experiment and draw upon the agency of formal and graphic types as means to explore figure, geometry, and representational relations.
